## Workshop Content

Researchers of today are witnessing a digital and data driven transformation changing the way research is done – and this is especially true for digital humanities. In addition, new regulations on national and international level impose requirements that researchers must adhere to, while the expectations of Open Science and the free sharing of research data is becoming more prominent. In this full-day workshop we will explore hands-on how you as a researcher in digital humanities can more effectively navigate this landscape and learn practical skills for handling your research data from their collection, refinement and analysis to their publication and long term storage and archiving. 
This course addresses new requirements and guidelines related to the management and sharing of research data: during and after the project’s lifetime. We will consider the planning work associated with research data management as an integral part of project planning. We take a practical approach to solve the data management problem from the perspective of both project managers and project participants. The workshop participants will gain a deeper understanding of what a data management plan is. The workshop also includes a detailed walkthrough of a data management plan, addressing important practical issues in creating one. We will familiarize ourselves with ‘good enough practices’ for data handling and research software development. After the workshop, every participant will go home with a customized guide for research data management they can start implementing in ongoing and planned projects.
